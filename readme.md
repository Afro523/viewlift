This is my attempt at the ViewLift test.

To run just download the repo and run npm install in the root folder.  From there you can use npm start to run the app.

The structure is very simple.  The entry point is index.js where I setup the routes.

From there you are automatically routed to the Login.jsx component.  On successful login you are redirected to the Home.jsx component.  In there you have the data coming in after component is mounted and then passing the props to child components once the data is loaded.

Thank you for the time and opportunity.  I look forward to meeting the team in person.
